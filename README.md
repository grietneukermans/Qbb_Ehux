Backsacttering efficiency factors for coccoliths and coccospheres of Emiliania huxleyi

Qbb_lith.m: matlab function that computes the backscattering efficiency factor for an Ehux coccolith composed of material of given index of refraction (real or complex), r0 the radius of the coccolithophore core as in Fig. 2 [microns] of the corresponding paper, nspoke=number of spokes in the coccolith [dim], lambda=light wavelength in water [microns]. 

Qbb_coccolithophore.m: matlab function that computes the backscattering efficiency factor for an Ehux coccolithophore composed of lith material of given index of refraction (real or complex), with a known refractive index of the core material (provided in the code) with radius r0 as in Fig. 2 [microns] of the corresponding paper, nspoke=number of spokes in the coccolith [dim], lambda=light wavelength in water [microns], and Ovl the number of layers of liths attached to the core.

Volume_lith.m: matlab function that computes the volume of a coccolith.
